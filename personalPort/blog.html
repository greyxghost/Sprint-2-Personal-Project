            <h2>Wrapping Up the Sprint</h2>
            <p class="date">Dec 11th, 2024</p>
            <p>
              As this sprint comes to an end, I’m feeling proud of how much I’ve
              learned and achieved. This sprint focused heavily on React and its
              applications, and I’ve gained a solid understanding of its core
              concepts. I’ve built components, managed state, and explored how
              React can simplify complex workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing, however, remains a challenge for me. I know it will
              require more practice in the future, but that’s to be expected
              when diving into something new. I’m excited to improve this skill
              over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it has been a productive and rewarding sprint. I’m
              looking forward to Semester 3, where I’ll continue to build on
              what I’ve learned, develop new skills, and maintain my projects as
              I progress. Thank you for following along on this journey, and
              I’m eager to see what’s next!

            <h2>First Blog Post</h2>
            <p class="date">Dec 3rd, 2024</p>
            <p>
              As a college student passionate about web design and development,
              I’m excited to use this space to document my journey, share my
              work, and connect with others in the field. Every day, I’m
              learning something new, and this blog is my way of reflecting on
              that growth while showcasing the projects I’ve been working on.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few of the projects I’ve completed so far:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Major City Weather App:</strong> A weather application
                that fetches real-time weather data using a city name, built
                with an API integration. This project taught me a lot about
                working with external data and creating functional,
                user-friendly designs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic Python Calculator:</strong> A simple yet effective
                calculator built in Python that performs basic arithmetic
                operations. I added features like error handling to ensure
                smooth usability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Snake Game:</strong> A recreation of the classic snake
                game, built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was a fun way to
                work on game mechanics and bring a nostalgic concept to life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I’ll be uploading these projects to my GitHub soon, so you can
              explore the code and see how they work. This journey has been
              incredibly rewarding, and I look forward to continuing to refine
              my skills and create even more meaningful projects. Thank you for
              stopping by—I’m excited to share more with you as I continue to
              grow in this field.
